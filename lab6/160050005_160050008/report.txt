To run the code, we have to replace the src and WebContent directories of a project in eclipse.
It will run as expected in the assignment (will have to change te Config.java file to speify the database username/password/port).

The entry point in the login page at LoginServlet which redirects (upon successful login to the Home page)

We have implemented a new search button  for createConversation and displayConversation (other than the one already in table). The displayConversation button only allows to select from options that are suggested by dropdown and nothing else (as no conversation exists for users that are not in the drop-down list). As mentioned in the question statement we check only for users for whom the text entered is a prefix of the phone number, name or uid,

We have also implemented the Bonus part where we ensure that the options shown for the search box at the top are the ones with which a conversation already exists and the suggestions for "CreateConversation" are only those with which a conversation does not already exist. 


To display the details of a conversation, we had initilly implemented it using the JQuery DataTables plugin (similar to how all the users with which a conversation exist are displayed) but changed it to the XML query, which displays a less-formatted (though accurate) table for the details of every conversation
